# IoT Freezer Temperature Monitor
This tutorial covers everything you'll need to build and run your own freezer temperature monitor and alert system. We'll cover how to build the device, setting up a free online database, flashing code onto the device, monitoring the database and sending email alerts. The components used in this project can measure temperatures as low as -200 celsius.

This project takes about 60 to 90 minutes to build.

## Prerequisites

1. AdafruitIO account, you can sign up for free account [here](https://accounts.adafruit.com/users/sign_up)  
1. IFTTT Account, you can join IFTTT [here](https://ifttt.com/join)

## Build
![](/media/fullbuild.jpg)
1. Solder the screw terminal to the top side of your MCP9600.
    ![](/media/build01.jpg)
1. Solder the pins to the bottom side of the MCP9600.  
    > *Tip: Put the pins in the breadboard to hold them in place when soldering.*

    ![](/media/build02.jpg)
1. Connect the ESP32 and MCP9600 to the breadboard.
1. Follow the wiring diagram below to connect the MCP9600 to the ESP32 using your jumper wires.

1. Connect the Thermocouple to the screw terminals on the MCP9600

## Code

Clone this repo to your computer, or you can download the directory for this project [here](https://github.com/microsoft/freezer-temp-monitor/archive/main.zip)

Once you downloaded the project files you'll need to create a config.h file and fill in your AdafruitIO and WiFi credentials.

1. In the *FreezerTempAlert* folder create a new text file called *config.h*

1. Copy and paste the code below into that that file and save:
    ```C++
    /************************ Adafruit IO Config *******************************/

    // visit io.adafruit.com if you need to create an account,
    // or if you need your Adafruit IO key.
    #define IO_USERNAME "your-username"
    #define IO_KEY "your-key"

    /******************************* WIFI **************************************/

    #define WIFI_SSID "your-ssid"
    #define WIFI_PASS "your-password"

    #include "AdafruitIO_WiFi.h"

    AdafruitIO_WiFi io(IO_USERNAME, IO_KEY, WIFI_SSID, WIFI_PASS);
    ```

1. Find your Adafruit IO credentials in the top right corner of the Adafruit IO webpage. 
    ![Adafruit IO Webpage](/media/iokeys.png)

1. Copy and paste them in here between the quotes:
    ```C++
    #define IO_USERNAME "your_username"
    #define IO_KEY "your_key"
    ```
    >*Remember to treat your key like a password*
1. Next you will need to add the WiFi SSID, or network name, and the password. Note: The code doesn't support WiFi networks that use a captive portal.
    ```C++
    #define WIFI_SSID "your_ssid"
    #define WIFI_PASS "your_pass"
    ```

1. Open *FreezerTempAlert.ino* and change the threshold temperature to the temperature you wanted to be alerted at. The default temperature is -50 celsius.
    ```C++
    // Set the temperature you want to be alerted at
    const float thresholdTemperature = -50;
    ```

## Flashing the code

1. Follow the first section of this [guide](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/) to add the ESP32 extension to the Arduino IDE.

1. Install the libraries listed below using Arduino's Library manager. If you have used the library manager before [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries) is a helpful guide.
    1. Adafruit IO Arduino
    1. Adafruit MCP9600
    > Note: If you're prompted to install other dependencies for these libraries, select *Install All*

1. With FreezerTempAlert.ino open in the Arduino IDE select **Tools>Board>Adafruit ESP32 Feather**

1. Select the active COM Port in **Tools>Port**

1. Press the *Upload* button   
    ![Arduino upload button](/media/upload.png)

    > Note: If you output monitor prints out *Connecting......._____*
you'll need to press the boot button on your ESP32 board. You may have to press boot more than once for it to work.

1. Open the Arduino serial monitor to verify that everything is working properly on the board.

1. Go back to Adafruit.io and check that both the *temperature* feed and the *temp_alert* feed were created.

## Setting up IFTTT

You'll use If This Than That (IFTTT) to set up automated alerts to your email any time the temperatures goes above a threshold. The threshold is set to -50c by default.

1. Log in to your IFTTT account and press the **Create** button in the top navigation. 
    ![](/media/ifttt01.png)
1. Select the **+** button to add a trigger.
    ![](/media/ifttt02.png)
1. Search for **Adafruit**
    ![](/media/ifttt03.png)
1. Follow the prompts to connect and authenticate your Adafruit IO account.
1. Once your account is connected choose the *Any new data* trigger.
![](/media/ifttt04.png)
1. Select *temp_alert* from the drop down menu.
![](/media/ifttt05.png)
1. Select the next **+** to set your action.
    ![](/media/ifttt06.png)
1. Scroll down or search for the *Email* action
    ![](/media/ifttt08.png)
    > If this is the first time you're using the email action a pin will be sent to you to confirm that you are the owner of the email account.
1. Customized the email message and select *create action*
    ![](/media/ifttt09.png)
1. Finally select *finish*, your IFTTT service is ready to go.

## Installing

Now that you project is built and your services are setup you can install the thermocouple in the freezer. You can use a binder clip or a magnet to keep it in place. The ESP32 board should be kept outside the freezer. Many breadboards come with an adhesive back, you can use that to secure your project to the side of the freezer.
